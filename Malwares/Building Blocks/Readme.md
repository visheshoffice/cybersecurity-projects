# Building Blocks Repository Documentation

## Introduction

The "Building Blocks" repository is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various functionalities, including command execution, file download, execution report generation, and remote password stealing. These scripts are intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.

## Scripts

1. **command_execution.py**

   This script demonstrates how to execute shell commands using Python's `subprocess` module. It takes a command as input and executes it using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module.

2. **execution_report.py**

   This script generates an execution report by executing a command and sending the output via email. It uses the `subprocess` module to execute the command and the `smtplib` module to send the email.

3. **file_download.py**

   This script downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to the local filesystem. It uses the `requests` module to download the file and the `open` function to save it to the local filesystem.

4. **remote_password_stealer.py**

   This script downloads and executes the `laZagne.exe` tool, which is a password recovery tool. It then sends the recovered passwords via email. This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.
