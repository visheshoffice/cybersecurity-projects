# Keylogger

## Overview

The "Keylogger" is a Python-based keylogging tool that captures keyboard inputs and sends them via email at regular intervals. It consists of two main parts:

1. **keylogger_code**: This is the core functionality of the keylogger. It includes the `Keylogger` class, which is responsible for capturing keystrokes, processing them, and sending the logs via email.

2. **keylogger**: This is the main file that imports the `Keylogger` class from `keylogger_code` and initializes it with the desired parameters (interval, email, password).

## Installation

To use the Keylogger, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Keylogger.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Keylogger` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Keylogger
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Keylogger, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Keylogger` class from `keylogger_code`:

   ```python
   import keylogger_code
   ```

2. Initialize the `Keylogger` class with the desired parameters:

   ```python
   my_keylogger = keylogger_code.Keylogger(interval, email, password)
   ```

   Replace `interval`, `email`, and `password` with your desired values. The `interval` parameter specifies the time interval (in seconds) at which the logs will be sent via email.

3. Start the keylogger:

   ```python
   my_keylogger.start()
   ```

   This will start capturing keystrokes and sending the logs via email at the specified interval.

## Commands

The following command can be used to stop the execution of the keylogger:

```bash
killall python
```

This command will terminate all running Python processes, including the keylogger.

## Security Considerations

- **Privacy**: Be aware that keyloggers can capture sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. Use the Keylogger responsibly and only on your own devices or with explicit consent from others.

- **Email Credentials**: Avoid hardcoding email credentials in the code. Instead, consider using environment variables or a configuration file to store sensitive information securely.

- **Firewall**: Ensure that your firewall settings allow outgoing SMTP connections on port 587 (for Gmail) to avoid any issues with sending emails.

- **Legal Considerations**: Be aware of the legal implications of using keyloggers. In many jurisdictions, unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and can result in severe penalties.
