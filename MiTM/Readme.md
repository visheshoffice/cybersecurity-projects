# MiTM GitHub Repository Documentation

## Introduction

The "MiTM" GitHub repository contains a collection of tools for performing various types of Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks. These components can be used for educational purposes to learn about network security and the techniques used by attackers, but should not be used for malicious purposes.

## Components

1. [arp_spoofer](#arp_spoofer)
2. [code_injector](#code_injector)
3. [dns_spoofer](#dns_spoofer)
4. [file_interceptor](#file_interceptor)
5. [net_cut](#net_cut)
6. [packet_sniffer](#packet_sniffer)

## Usage Instructions

To use these components, you must run the `arp_spoofer.py` script first. This script will perform an ARP spoofing attack, which is required for the other components to work properly. After running the `arp_spoofer.py` script, you can run any of the other components to perform the desired attack.

## Requirements

These components require the following Python libraries to be installed:

- `scapy` (for packet manipulation)
- `netfilterqueue` (for interacting with the Linux netfilter queue)
- `argparse` (for parsing command-line arguments)
- `re` (for regular expressions)

Additionally, the `code_injector.py` component requires the `scapy_http` library to be installed.

## Security Considerations

These components are designed for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious purposes. Unauthorized use of these components may violate local, state, or federal laws. Use at your own risk.

## Disclaimer

The author of these components is not responsible for any damages or legal consequences resulting from the use of these components. Use at your own risk.

## Components

### arp_spoofer

This component is designed to perform an ARP spoofing attack. ARP spoofing is a technique where an attacker sends fake (spoofed) ARP messages onto a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once this is done, the attacker can intercept, modify, or block the communication between the two parties.

### code_injector

This component is designed to intercept and modify HTTP traffic. It can be used to inject arbitrary code into web pages being served over HTTP. This can be used for various purposes, including injecting malicious code into web pages, redirecting users to phishing sites, or performing other types of attacks.

### dns_spoofer

This component is designed to perform a DNS spoofing attack. DNS spoofing is a technique where an attacker intercepts and modifies DNS traffic to redirect users to malicious websites. This can be used for various purposes, including phishing attacks, malware distribution, and other types of attacks.

### file_interceptor

This component is designed to intercept and modify file downloads over HTTP. It can be used to replace files being downloaded with malicious files, redirect users to phishing sites, or perform other types of attacks.

### net_cut

This component is designed to perform a network cut attack. A network cut attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker disrupts the normal operation of a network by cutting off its connection to the internet. This can be used to disrupt communication between devices on the network, or to disrupt the operation of internet-connected devices.

### packet_sniffer

This component is designed to intercept and analyze network traffic. It can be used to capture and analyze packets being sent over a network, including passwords, usernames, and other sensitive information.

## Conclusion

The "MiTM" GitHub repository provides a collection of tools for performing various types of Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks. These components can be used for educational purposes to learn about network security and the techniques used by attackers, but should not be used for malicious purposes.
